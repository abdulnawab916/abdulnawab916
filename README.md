# Hey, I’m Abdul Nawab.

I enjoy working at the systems-level of programming, yet, I still like to write frontend code from time to time. 

All in all, I like helping others through the art of programming.

Currently, I work as a Software Engineer & Consultant for INOX, by Unison Hardware, which is based in Sacramento, CA.

### Personal interests:
- Systems-level Programming (C, C++, Rust)
- Computer Networks, both theory and application
- Computational Theory
