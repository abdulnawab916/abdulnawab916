# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m Abdul Nawab

Iâ€™m a software engineer with a background in computer science and a passion for building systems that are fast, clean, and reliable. I enjoy working across the stack â€” from backend infrastructure and APIs to occasional UI polish â€” and I love solving real problems with code.

### Interests

- Machine learning platforms & infrastructure (training, deployment, scaling)
- Systems programming & distributed networking
- Developer tooling and automation
- Clean, testable code and collaborative engineering culture
