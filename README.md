# Hey there, I’m Abdul Nawab

I’m a software engineer with a background in computer science / electrical engineering and a passion for building systems that are fast, clean, and reliable. I enjoy working across the stack, from backend infrastructure and APIs to occasional UI polish, and I love solving real problems with code.

### Interests

- Machine learning platforms & infrastructure (training, deployment, scaling)
- Systems programming & distributed networking
- Developer tooling and automation
- Clean, testable code and collaborative engineering culture
