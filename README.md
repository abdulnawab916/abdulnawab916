# Hey, I’m Abdul Nawab!

I’m a software engineer with a background in computer science & electrical engineering.
I have a passion for building systems that are fast, clean, and reliable. I enjoy working at the systems-level of programming, yet still like to write frontend code from time to time. All in all, I like helping others with programming.
